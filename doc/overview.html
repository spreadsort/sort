  <h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>  
  <p>
        The Boost Sort library provides a generic implementation of high-speed sorting algorithms 
		that outperform those in the C++ standard in both average and worst case performance.
		These algorithms only work on random access iterators.  
		They are hybrids using both radix and comparison-based sorting, 
		specialized to sorting common data types, such as integers, floats, and strings.
		These algorithms are encoded in a generic fashion and accept functors, 
		enabling them to sort any object that can be processed like these basic data types.
		Sample usages are available in the samples directory.
</p><p>
		Unlike many radix-based algorithms,  the underlying Spreadsort algorithm is designed around 
		worst-case performance.  It performs better on chunky data (where it is not widely distributed), 
		so that on real data it can perform substantially better than on random data.
		Conceptually, Spreadsort can sort any data for which an absolute ordering can be determined, and string_sort is sufficiently flexible that this should be possible. 
		Situations where Spreadsort is fastest relative to std::sort:
</p><p> 1. Large number of elements to sort (N >> 1000)
</p><p> 2. Slow comparison function (such as floating point numbers on x86 processors or strings)
</p><p> 3. Large data elements (such as key + data sorted on a key) 
</p><p> Situations where Spreadsort is slowest relative to std::sort:
</p><p> 1. Integers and mostly-sorted data on x86 processors
</p><p>    
        These functions are defined in namespace <code class="computeroutput">boost</code>.
    </p>

  <h2><a name="overloading" id="overloading"></a>Overloading</h2>

  <p>
    Each of <a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a>, <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a>, and <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> have 3 main versions:
<p></p> The base version, which takes a first iterator and a last iterator, just like std::sort:
<p></p> <a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a>(array.begin(), array.end());
<p></p> The version with an overridden shift functor, 
        providing flexibility in case the >> already does something other than a bitshift.
        The rightshift functor takes two args, first the data type, 
        and second a natural number of bits to shift right.
        For <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> this variant is slightly different; 
        it needs a bracket functor equivalent to [], taking a number corresponding to the character offset,
        along with a second getlength functor to get the length of the string in characters.
        In all cases, this operator must return an integer type that compares with the "<" operator to
        provide the intended order (integers can be negated to reverse their order).
        In other words: rightshift(A, n) &lt; rightshift(B, n) -&gt; A &lt; B
<p></p> <a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a>(array.begin(), array.end(), rightshift());
<p></p> And the version with a comparison functor for maximum flexibility.
        This functor must provide the same sorting order as the integers returned by the rightshift:
        rightshift(A, n) &lt; rightshift(B, n) -&gt; compare(A, B)
<p></p> <a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a>(array.begin(), array.end(), negrightshift(), std::greater&lt;Data_type&gt;());
    </p>

  <h2><a name="performance" id="performance"></a>Performance</h2>
  <p>
        The Spreadsort algorithm is a hybrid algorithm; when the number of elements being sorted is
        below a certain number, comparison-based sorting is used.  Above it, radix sorting
        is used.  The radix-based algorithm will thus cut up the problem into small pieces,
        and either completely sort the data based upon its radix if the data is clustered,
        or finish sorting the cut-down pieces with comparison-based sorting.
</p><p> The Spreadsort algorithm dynamically chooses either comparison-based or radix-based sorting
        when recursing, whichever provides better worst-case performance.
        This way worst-case performance is guaranteed to be the better of <img src="equation/introsort.png" alt="O(N*log(N))" /> comparisons and 
        <img src="equation/worst.png" alt="O(N*log(K/S + S))" /> operations where N is the number of elements being sorted, 
        K is the length in bits of the key, and S is a constant.  
        This results in substantially improved performance for large N; <a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a> tends
        to be 50% to 2X faster than std::sort, 
        while <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a> and <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> are roughly 2X faster than std::sort.  
</p><p> Performance graphs are provided for <a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a>, <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a>, 
        and <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> in their description.
        Runtime Performance comparisons and graphs were made on a Core 2 Duo laptop running 
        Windows Vista 64 with MSVC 8.0, 
        and an old G4 laptop running Mac OSX with gcc.  
        bjam was used to control compilation.
</p><p>
        Histogramming with a fixed maximum number of splits is used because it reduces the 
        number of cache misses, thus improving performance relative to the approach described in 
        detail in the 
        <a href="original_spreadsort06_2002.pdf">Original Spreadsort Algorithm</a>.
        The importance of cache-friendly histogramming is described in the paper on 
        <a href="bibliography.html#alr">Adaptive Left Radix</a>, 
        though without the worst-case handling described below.
</p><p> The time taken per radix iteration is:
</p><p> O(N) iterations over the data
</p><p> O(N) integer-type comparisons (even for <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a> and <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a>)
</p><p> O(N) swaps
</p><p> <img src="equation/bins.png" alt="O(2^S)" /> bin operations
</p><p> To obtain O(N) worst-case performance per iteration, 
        the restriction <img src="equation/bin_limit.png" alt="S <= log(N)" /> is applied, 
        and <img src="equation/bins.png" alt="O(2^S)" /> becomes O(N).
        For each such iteration, the number of unsorted bits log(range) (referred to as K) 
        per element is reduced by S.
        As S decreases depending upon the amount of elements being sorted, 
        it can drop from a maximum of <img src="equation/s_max.png" alt="S_max" /> to the minimum of <img src="equation/s_min.png" alt="S_min" />.
</p><p> Assumption: std::sort is assumed to be <img src="equation/introsort.png" alt="O(N*log(N))" />.  
        As <a href="bibliography.html#introsort">introsort</a> exists and is commonly used, 
        if you have a quibble with this please
        take it up with the implementor of your std::sort; you're welcome to replace the
        recursive calls to std::sort to calls to <a href="bibliography.html#introsort">introsort</a> 
        if your std::sort library call is poorly implemented.  
        <a href="bibliography.html#introsort">Introsort</a> is not included with this algorithm for simplicity
        and because the implementor of the std::sort call is assumed to know what they're doing.
</p><p> To maintain a minimum value for S (<img src="equation/s_min.png" alt="S_min" />), 
        comparison-based sorting has to be used
        to sort when <img src="equation/min_n_orig.png" alt="n <= log(meanbinsize)" />, 
        where <a href="constants.html#int_log_mean_bin_size">log(meanbinsize)</a> (lbs) is a small
        constant, usually between 0 and 4, used to minimize bin overhead per element. 
        There is a small corner-case where if <img src="equation/lt_smin.png" alt="K < S_min" /> and 
        <img src="equation/gte_2k.png" alt="n >= 2^K" />, 
        then the data can be sorted in a single radix-based iteration with an S = K
        (this bucketsorting special case is by default only applied to <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a>).
        So for the final recursion, worst-case performance is:
        1 radix-based iteration if <img src="equation/lte_smin.png" alt="K <= S_min" />, or
        <img src="equation/smin_lbs.png" alt="S_min + lbs" /> comparison-based iterations if 
        <img src="equation/gt_smin.png" alt="K > S_min" /> but 
        <img src="equation/min_n.png" alt="n <= 2^(S_min + lbs)" />.
        So for the final iteration, worst-case runtime is 
        <img src="equation/min_comparison.png" alt="O(N*(S_min + lbs))" />.
        if <img src="equation/gt_smin.png" alt="K > S_min" /> and 
        <img alt="N > 2^(S_min + lbs)" src="equation/n_gt_smin.png" />, 
        then more than 1 radix recursion will be required.
</p><p> For the second to last iteration, <img alt="K <= S_min * 2 + 1" src="equation/x2plus1.png" /> can be handled,
        (if the data is divided into <img alt="2^(S_min + 1)" src="equation/smin1.png" /> pieces) 
        or if <img alt="N < 2^(S_min + lbs + 1)" src="equation/sminlbs1.png" />, 
        then it is faster to fallback to std::sort.
        In the case of a radix-based sort plus recursion, 
        it will take <img alt="O(N*(S_min + lbs)) + O(N) = O(N*(S_min + lbs + 1))" src="equation/worst1.png" /> 
        worst-case time,
        as <img alt="K_remaining = K_start - (S_min + 1)" src="equation/k_remaining.png" />, 
        and <img alt="K_start <= S_min * 2 + 1" src="equation/k_start.png" />.
        Alternatively, comparison-based sorting is used if 
        <img alt="N < 2^(S_min + lbs + 1)" src="equation/sminlbs1.png" />,
        which will take <img alt="O(N*(S_min + lbs + 1))" src="equation/min1_comparison.png" /> time.  
        So either way <img alt="O(N*(S_min + lbs + 1))" src="equation/min1_comparison.png" /> 
        is the worst-case time for the second 
        to last iteration, which occurs if <img alt="K <= S_min * 2 + 1" src="equation/k1.png" /> 
        or <img alt="N < 2^(S_min + lbs + 1)" src="equation/sminlbs1.png" />.
</p><p> This continues as long as <img alt="S_min <= S <= S_max" src="equation/srange.png" />, so that for
        <img alt="K_m <= K_(m-1) + S_min + m" src="equation/kincr.png" />
        where m is the maximum number of iterations after this one has finished,
        or where <img alt="N < 2^(S_min + lbs + m)" src="equation/nincr.png" />, 
        then the worst-case runtime is <img alt="O(N*(S_min + lbs + m))" src="equation/incr_compare.png" />.
</p><p> <img alt="K_m" src="equation/km.png" /> at <img alt="m <= (S_max - S_min)" src="equation/mrange.png" />
        works out to:
</p><p> <img alt="K_1 <= (S_min) + S_min + 1 <= 2S_min + 1" src="equation/k_1.png" />
</p><p> <img alt="K_2 <= (2S_min + 1) + S_min + 2" src="equation/k_2.png" />
</p><p> as the sum from 0 to m is <img alt="m(m + 1)/2" src="equation/msum.png" />
</p><p> <img alt="K_m <= (m + 1)S_min + m(m + 1)/2 <= (S_min + m/2)(m + 1)" src="equation/k_m.png" />
</p><p> substituting in <img alt="S_max - S_min" src="equation/s_diff.png" /> for m
</p><p> <img alt="K_(S_max - S_min) <= (S_min + (S_max - S_min)/2)*(S_max - S_min + 1)" src="equation/k_smax.png" />
</p><p> <img alt="K_(S_max - S_min) <= (S_min + S_max) * (S_max - S_min + 1)/2" src="equation/k_smax_final.png" />
</p><p> since this involves <img alt="S_max - S_min + 1" src="equation/s_max_iters.png" /> iterations, 
        this works out to dividing K into an average 
        <img alt="(S_min + S_max)/2" src="equation/smean.png" /> pieces per iteration.
        To finish the problem from this point takes 
        <img alt="O(N * (S_max - S_min))" src="equation/radix_iters.png" /> for m 
        iterations, plus the worst-case of <img src="equation/min_comparison.png" alt="O(N*(S_min + lbs))" /> 
        for the last iteration, for a total of 
        <img alt="O(N *(S_max + lbs))" src="equation/smax_total_iters.png" /> time.
</p><p> When <img alt="m > S_max - S_min" src="equation/bigm.png" />, 
        the problem is divided into <img src="equation/s_max.png" alt="S_max" /> pieces per iteration,
        or std::sort is called if <img alt="N < 2^(m + S_min + lbs)" src="equation/fallback.png" />.  
        For this range:
</p><p> <img alt="K_m <= K_(m - 1) + S_max" src="equation/ktop.png" />
        Providing runtime of 
        <img alt="O(N *((K - K_(S_max - S_min))/S_max + S_max + lbs))" src="equation/iter_combined.png" /> 
        if recursive,
        or <img alt="O(N * log(2^(m + S_min + lbs)))" src="equation/compare_combined.png" /> if comparison-based,
</p><p> which simplifies to <img alt="O(N * (m + S_min + lbs))" src="equation/compare_simplified.png" />, 
        which substitutes to
        <img alt="O(N * ((m - (S_max - S_min)) + S_max + lbs))" src="equation/comp_sub.png" />,
</p><p> which given that 
        <img alt="m - (S_max - S_min) <= (K - K_(S_max - S_min))/S_max" src="equation/m_limit.png" />
        (otherwise a lesser number of radix-based iterations would be used)
</p><p> also comes out to 
        <img alt="O(N *((K - K_(S_max - S_min))/S_max + S_max + lbs))" src="equation/compare_asymptote.png" />.
</p><p> Asymptotically, for large N and large K, this simplifies to:
        <img alt="O(N * (K/S_max + S_max + lbs))" src="equation/asymptote.png" />, 
        simplifying out the constants related to the <img alt="S_max - S_min" src="equation/s_diff.png" /> range.
        Providing an additional <img alt="O(N * (S_max + lbs))" src="equation/lsd_offset.png" /> 
        runtime on top of the <img alt="O(N * (K/S))" src="equation/lsd.png" /> performance
        of LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a>, but without the O(N) memory overhead.
        For simplicity, because lbs is a small constant (0 can be used, and performs reasonably), 
        it is ignored when summarizing the performance in further discussions.
        By checking whether comparison-based sorting is better, 
        Spreadsort is also <img src="equation/introsort.png" alt="O(N*log(N))" />,
        whichever is better, and unlike LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a>, 
        can perform much better than the worst-case
        if the data is either evenly distributed or highly clustered.
</p><p> This analysis was for <a href= "integer_sort.html" />integer_sort</a> and 
        <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a>.  
        <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> differs in that S_min = S_max = sizeof(Char_type) * 8, 
        lbs is 0, and that std::sort's comparison is not
        a constant-time operation, so strictly speaking string_sort runtime is 
        <img alt="O(N * (K/S_max + (S_max comparisons)))" src="equation/string_sort.png" />.  
        Worst-case, this ends up being O(N * K) (where K is the mean string length in bytes), 
        as described for <a href="bibliography.html#american_flag_sort">American Flag Sort</a>, 
        which is better than
        the O(N * K * log(N)) worst-case for comparison-based sorting.

  <h2><a name="tuning" id="tuning"></a>Tuning and Testing</h2>
<p>
		<a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a> and <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a> 
		have tuning constants that control how the radix-sorting portion
		of those algorithms work.
		The ideal <a href="constants.html">constant values</a> for 
		<a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a> and <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a> 
		vary depending on the platform, compiler, and data being sorted.  
		By far the most important constant is <a href="constants.html#max_splits">max_splits</a>, 
		which defines how many pieces the radix-sorting portion splits the data into per iteration.  
</p><p> The ideal value of <a href="constants.html#max_splits">max_splits</a> depends upon the size of the L1 processor cache, 
		and is between 10 and 13 on many systems.  A default value of 11 is used.
        For mostly-sorted data, a much larger value is better, as swaps (and thus cache misses) are
        rare, but this hurts runtime severely for unsorted data, so is not recommended.
</p><p> On some x86 systems when the total number of elements being sorted is small (
        less than 1 million or so), the ideal 
        <a href="constants.html#max_splits">max_splits</a> can be substantially larger, such as 17.  
        This is suspected to be because all the data fits into the L2 cache, 
        and misses from L1 cache to L2 cache do not impact performance as severely as misses to 
        main memory.
        Modifying <a href="constants.html">tuning constants</a> other than 
        <a href="constants.html#max_splits">max_splits</a> is not recommended, as the performance 
        improvement for changing other constants is usually minor.
</p><p> 
        If you can afford to let it run for a day, and have at least 1GB of free memory, 
        the perl command: "./tune.pl -large -tune" (UNIX) or "perl tune.pl -large -tune -windows" (Windows)
        can be used to automatically tune <a href="constants.html">these constants</a>.
        This should be run from the libs/sort/sort directory inside the boost home directory.
		This will work to identify the ideal constants.hpp settings for your system, 
		testing on various distributions in a 20 million element (80MB) file, 
		and additionally verifies that all sorting routines sort correctly across various data 
		distributions.  
		Alternatively, you can test with the file size you're most concerned with 
		"./tune.pl number -tune" (UNIX) or "perl tune.pl number -tune -windows" (Windows).
		Substitute the number of elements you want to test with for "number".
		Otherwise, just use the options it comes with, they're decent.
		With default settings "./tune.pl -tune" (UNIX) "perl tune.pl -tune -windows" (Windows),
		the script will take hours to run (less than a day), 
		but may not pick the correct <a href="constants.html#max_splits">max_splits</a> if it is over 10.
		Alternatively, you can add the -small option to make it take just a few minutes,
		tuning for smaller vector sizes (one hundred thousand elements), 
		but the resulting constants may not be good for large files 
		(see above note about <a href="constants.html#max_splits">max_splits</a> on Windows).
</p><p> The tuning script can also be used just to verify that sorting works correctly on your system, 
        and see how much of a speedup it gets, by omiting the "-tune" option.  
        This runs at the end of tuning runs.
        Default args will take about an hour to run and give accurate results on decent-sized test vectors.
        "./tune.pl -small" (UNIX) "perl tune.pl -small -windows" (Windows) is a faster option,
        that tests on smaller vectors and isn't as accurate.
</p><p> If any differences are encountered during tuning, please call tune.pl with -debug &gt; log_file_name.
    If the resulting log file contains compilation or permissions issues, it is likely an issue with your
    setup.  If some other type of error is encountered (or result differences), please send them
    to the library author at spreadsort@gmail.com.  
    Including the zipped input.txt that was being used is also helpful.
