  <h2><a name="radix" id="radix"></a>Radix Sorting</h2>

  <p>Radix-based sorting allows the data to be divided up into more than 2 pieces per iteration, 
	   and for cache-friendly versions, it normally cuts the data up into around a thousand pieces per iteration.
	   This allows many fewer iterations to be used to complete sorting the data, 
	   enabling performance superior to the <img src="equation/introsort.png" alt="O(N*log(N))" /> Comparison-based sorting limit.</p>
	   
  <h2><a name="hybrid" id="hybrid"></a>Hybrid Radix</h2>
  <p>There a two primary types of radix-based sorting:  
</p><p><b>Most-significant-digit Radix sorting</b> (MSD) divides the data recursively based upon the top-most unsorted bits.
		This approach is efficient for even distributions that divide nicely, 
		and can be done in-place (limited additional memory used).  
		There is substantial constant overhead for each iteration to deal with the splitting structure.
		The algorithms provided here use MSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> for their radix-sorting portion.
		The main disadvantage of MSD Radix sorting is that when the data is cut up into small pieces, 
		the overhead for additional recursive calls starts to dominate runtime, 
		and this makes worst-case behavior substantially worse than <img src="equation/introsort.png" alt="O(N*log(N))" />.
</p><p> By contrast, <a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a>, <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a>, and <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> all check to see whether Radix-based 
		or Comparison-based sorting have better worst-case runtime, and make the appropriate recursive call.
		Because Comparison-based sorting algorithms are efficient on small pieces, 
		the tendency of MSD radix sorts to cut the problem up small is turned into an advantage by
		these hybrid sorts.  
		It is hard to conceive of a common usage case where pure MSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> would have any significant
		advantage over hybrid algorithms.
</p><p><b>Least-significant-digit Radix sorting</b> (LSD) sorts based upon the least-significant bits first.
		This requires a complete copy of the data being sorted, using substantial additional memory.
		The main advantage of LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> is that aside from some constant overhead and the memory allocation,
		it uses a fixed amount of time per element to sort, regardless of distribution or size of the list.
		This amount of time is proportional to the length of the radix.
		The other advantage of LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> is that it is a stable sorting algorithm, 
		so elements with the same key will retain their original order.
</p><p> One disadvantage is that LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> uses the same amount of time to sort "easy" sorting problems
		as "hard" sorting problems, 
		and this time spent may end up being greater than an efficient <img src="equation/introsort.png" alt="O(N*log(N))" /> algorithm such
		as <a href="bibliography.html#introsort">introsort</a> spends sorting "hard" problems on large data sets, 
		depending on the length of the datatype, and relative speed of comparisons, 
		memory allocation, and random accesses.
</p><p> The other main disadvantage of LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> is its memory overhead.  
		It's only faster for large data sets, but large data sets use significant memory,
		which LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> needs to duplicate.
		LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> doesn't make sense for items of variable length, such as strings; 
		it could be implemented by starting at the end of the longest element, 
		but would be extremely inefficient.
		All that said, there are places where LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> is the appropriate and fastest solution,
		so it would be appropriate to create a templated LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> similar to <a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a> and <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a>.
		This would be most appropriate in cases where comparisons are extremely slow.
</p>

  <h2><a name="sort" id="spread_sort"></a>why spread_sort?</h2>
  <p>The Spreadsort algorithm used in this library is designed to provide best possible worst-case performance, 
		while still being cache-friendly.  
		It provides the better of <img src="equation/worst.png" alt="O(N*log(K/S + S))" /> and <img src="equation/introsort.png" alt="O(N*log(N))" /> worst-case time,
		where K is the log of the range.
		The log of the range is normally the length in bits of the data type; 32 for a 32-bit integer.
</p><p><b>flash_sort</b> (another hybrid algorithm), by comparison is O(N) for evenly distributed lists.
		The problem is, flash_sort is merely an MSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> combined with O(N*N) insertion sort to deal
		with small subsets where the MSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> is inefficient, so it is inefficient with chunks of
		data around the size at which it switches to insertion_sort, and ends up operating as an
		enhanced MSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a>.  For uneven distributions this makes it especially inefficient.
</p><p> <a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a> and <a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a> use <a href="bibliography.html#introsort">introsort</a> instead, 
		which provides <img src="equation/introsort.png" alt="O(N*log(N))" /> performance for these medium-sized pieces.
		Also, flash_sort's O(N) performance for even distributions comes at the cost of cache misses,
		which on modern architectures are extremely expensive, and in testing on modern systems
		ends up being slower than cutting up the data in multiple, cache-friendly steps.
		Also worth noting is that on most modern computers, 
		log(available RAM)/log(L1 cache size) is around 3,
		where a cache miss takes more than 3 times as long as an in-cache random-access, 
		and the size of <a href="constants.html#MAX_SPLITS">MAX_SPLITS</a> is tuned to the size of the cache.
		On a computer where cache misses aren't this expensive, 
		<a href="constants.html#MAX_SPLITS">MAX_SPLITS</a> could be increased to a large value, or eliminated entirely,
		and <a href="integer_sort.html">integer_sort</a>/<a href="float_sort.html">float_sort</a> would have the same O(N) performance on even distributions.
</p><p> <a href="bibliography.html#alr">Adaptive Left Radix</a> (ALR) is similar to flash_sort, but more cache-friendly.  
        It still uses insertion_sort.  Because ALR uses O(N*N) insertion_sort, it isn't efficient to
        use the comparison-based fallback sort on large lists, and if the data is clustered in small chunks
        just over the fallback size with a few outliers, radix-based sorting iterates many times doing little sorting
        with high overhead.  Asymptotically, ALR is still <img src="equation/worst.png" alt="O(N*log(K/S + S))" />, but with a very small s
        (about 2 in the worst case), which compares unfavorably with the 11 default value of <a href="constants.html#MAX_SPLITS">MAX_SPLITS</a>
        for Spreadsort.  
</p><p> <a href="bibliography.html#alr">ALR</a> also does not have the <img src="equation/introsort.png" alt="O(N*log(N))" /> fallback, so for small lists 
        that are not evenly distributed it is extremely inefficient.  
        See the <a href="../example/alrbreaker.cpp">alrbreaker</a> and <a href="../example/binaryalrbreaker.cpp">binaryalrbreaker</a> testcases for examples; 
        either replace the call to sort with a call to ALR and update the
        ALR_THRESHOLD at the top, or as a quick comparison make get_max_count return ALR_THRESHOLD (20
        by default based upon the paper).  
        These small tests take 4-10 times as long with ALR as std::sort in the author's testing,
        depending on the test system, 
        because they are trying to sort a highly uneven distribution.  
        Normal Spreadsort does much better with them, because get_max_count is designed around minimizing
        worst-case runtime.
</p><p> <b>burst_sort</b> is an efficient hybrid algorithm for strings that uses substantial additional memory.  
		<a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> uses minimal additional memory by comparison.  
		Speed comparisons between the two haven't been made, 
		but the better memory efficiency makes <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> more general.
</p><p> <b>postal_sort</b> and <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> are similar.  A direct performance comparison would be welcome,
		but an efficient version of postal_sort was not found in a search for source.
</p><p> <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> is most similar to the <a href="bibliography.html#american_flag_sort">American Flag Sort</a> algorithm.
	    The main difference is that it doesn't bother trying to optimize how empty buckets/piles
	    are handled, instead just checking to see if all characters at the current index are equal.
	    Other differences are using std::sort as the fallback algorithm, 
	    and a larger fallback size (256 vs. 16), which makes empty pile handling less important.
</p><p> Another difference is not applying the stack-size restriction.
	    Because of the equality check in <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a>, it would take m*m memory worth
	    of strings to force <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> to create a stack of depth m.
	    This problem isn't a realistic one on modern systems with multi-megabyte stacksize
	    limits, where main memory would be exhausted holding the long strings necessary to
	    exceed the stacksize limit.
	    <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> can be thought of as modernizing <a href="bibliography.html#american_flag_sort">American Flag Sort</a> 
	    to take advantage of <a href="bibliography.html#introsort">introsort</a> as a fallback algorithm.  
	    In the author's testing, <a href="bibliography.html#american_flag_sort">American Flag Sort</a> (on std::strings) 
      had comparable runtime to <a href="bibliography.html#introsort">introsort</a>, but making a hybrid of the two allows reduced overhead and
	    substantially superior performance.
</p>

  <h2><a name="unstable" id="unstable"></a>Unstable sorting</h2>

  <p>Making a <a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a> stable requires the usage of an external copy of the data.
		A stable hybrid algorithm also requires a stable comparison-based algorithm,
		and these are generally slow.
		LSD <a href=bibliography.html#radix><a href=bibliography.html#radix>Radix Sort</a></a> uses an external copy of the data, and provides stability, 
		along with likely being faster (than a stable hybrid sort), 
		so that's probably a better way to go for integers and floats.
		It might make sense to make a stable version of <a href="string_sort.html">string_sort</a> using external memory,
		but for simplicity this has been left out for now.</p>

  <h2><a name="x86" id="x86"></a>Unused x86 optimization</h2>
<p>Though the ideal <a href="constants.html#MAX_SPLITS">MAX_SPLITS</a> for n < 1 million (or so) on x86 seems to be substantially larger,
enabling a roughly 15% speedup for such tests, this optimization isn't general, 
and doesn't apply for n > 1 million.  
        A too large <a href="constants.html#MAX_SPLITS">MAX_SPLITS</a> can cause sort to take more than twice as long,
        so it should be set on the low end of the reasonable range, where it is right now.
  <h2><a name="lookup" id="lookup"></a>Lookup table</h2>
  <p>The ideal way to optimize the constants would be to have a carefully tuned lookup table instead
       of the get_max_count function, but 4 tuning variables is simpler,
       get_max_count enforces worst-case performance minimization rules, and
       such a lookup table would be difficult to optimize for cross-platform performance.
</p><p>Alternatively, get_max_count could be used to generate a static lookup table.  
This hasn't been done due to concerns about cross-platform compatibility and flexibility.</p>
